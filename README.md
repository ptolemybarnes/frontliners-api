## Frontliners-API
  
The code here was written over the weekend of Feb 21/22, 2015 at the UN Influx Hackerthon.
After settling on a concept (described [here](https://detachedhead.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/the-un-influx-hackerthon/)
on my blog), our technical problem was to build a website that could interface with the [Rise platform](rise.global)
as well as twitter to display information about a selected group of people.  
  
The Frontliners team decided to do this by running our own API that could collate information from these two different sources
and serve it to a Meteor frontend. I worked mostly on the backend API, using node.
